<h1> Tips to protect against Online Fraud and Phishing Variations</h1>
<ul>
<li>* Be suspicious of any e-mail or text message containing urgent requests for personal or financial information (PMI and most other financial institutions and credit card companies normally will not use e-mail to confirm an existing client's information).</br>
* Contact the organization by using a telephone number from a credible source such as a phone book or a bill.</br>
* Always look out for the padlock Padlock and the URL address as https://www.onlinepmi.com/retail/login.htm when you log onto onlinePMI and https://m.onlinepmi.com/mretail/login.htm, when you log onto Mobile OnlinePMI.</br>
* To be absolutely sure, type www.onlinepmi.com or https://m.onlinepmi.com in the browser address bar.</br>
* If you receive an email claiming to be from PMI that appears to be suspicious, do not click on any links it provides or reply to it – simply delete it.</br>
* Avoid embedded links in an e-mail claiming to bring you to a secure site.</br>
* Never disclose via text message any personal information, including account numbers, passwords, or any combination of sensitive information that could be used fraudulently. Use caution if you receive a text message expressing an urgent need for you to update your information, activate an account, or verify your identity by calling a phone number or submitting information on a web site. These messages may be part of a phishing scam conducted by fraudsters to capture your confidential account information and commit fraud.</br>
* Get in the habit of looking at a website’s address line and verify if it displays something different from the address mentioned in the email.</br>
* Regularly update your computer protection with anti-virus software, spyware filters, e-mail filters and firewall programs.</br>
* As a general rule, be suspicious when receiving any unsolicited incoming communication/phone call asking your personal or financial information or asking to update them on a site. Contact your Bank directly through official channels available to verify authenticity of those calls.</li>
</ul>
Do not share any confidential information through suspicious emails, websites, social media networks, text messages or phone calls.
<ul>
<li>* Use a current web browser. View a current list of PMI’s supported browsers.</br>
* Your online banking username or password should not be the same as other online accounts.</br>
* Regularly check you bank, credit and debit card statements to ensure that all transactions are legitimate.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Protecting You Online</h3>
<ul>
<li>At PMI we use the highest industry standard for security. And we constantly review it to counter any new security threats.

Here are some of the steps we take to protect you while you’re banking online.</li>
</ul>
When you login:
<ul>
<li>* Access to your accounts is controlled by your unique username and password.</br>
* Your access is suspended after three invalid login attempts.</br>
* We show you the date and time of your last login so you know that no one else has accessed your accounts.</li>
</ul>
While you're banking online:
<ul>
<li>* We have 128-bit SSL encryption to keep your information secure. This basically means your information travels over the internet as a sophisticated code that only we can unscramble.</br>
* "High Security" provides you with an extra layer of protection when making payments online, adding third parties etc. This One Time based SMS password validates your identity and processes a transaction through.</br>
* Each of our secure websites has a SSL Extended Validation certificate issued by VeriSign to let you know that the website is genuine and secure.</br>
* ONLINEPMI and MOBILE ONLINESBI also has an Extended Validation (EV) SSL Certificate. This means that if you're using.</br>
* Internet Explorer 7, your address bar will turn green when you visit our sites. It makes it easy for you to be sure you are on the genuine OnlinePMI website.</br>
* For information on SSL certificates visit the Verisign website or to find out more about EV Certificates visit Microsoft's website.</li>
</ul>
When you're finished:
<ul>
<li>* You are automatically signed off from your account if it's inactive for a set period of time.</br>
* All pages you visit in our online banking websites are automatically removed from your browsers cache after you have logged off. This removes the opportunity for later users of that computer to view your personal or account details by, for example, selecting the browser back button or searching the contents of the computer's hard-drive.</li>
</ul>
Security experts at SBI behind the scenes:
<ul>
<li>* Our dedicated security team investigates new technologies, monitors activity and responds promptly to any emerging security issues.</br>

<h3>Safe Online Banking</h3>
Select a suitable password
<ul>
<li>* Unique Characters: An acceptable password must have at least eight (8) different characters. Repeated characters can make for palindromes and make it easier to crack.</br>
* Character Types: An acceptable password must have characters from at least three (3) different character types -- upper case, lower case, digits, punctuation, etc. A password that includes a sample from a rich character set is difficult to crack.</br>
* Long Alpha Sequences: An acceptable password must not have an alphabetic sequence any longer than three (3) characters.</br>
* Long Digit Sequences: An acceptable password must not have a digit sequence any longer than two (2) characters.</br>
* Forbidden Characters: There are a few characters that will cause problems if used in a password - the "delete" character is one of the obvious ones.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
One possible method for picking a good password is to make up your own acronym.</li>
</ul>
Always protect your password
<ul>
<li>* Sharing passwords is a security risk.</br>
* Do not divulge your password to anyone.</br>

* Do not provide user-id and passwords on any page that appears as a popup when you click on a hyperlink received through email. Better practice would be to log on to the service by typing in the URL in the address bar after making sure the page opening up is from the genuine service provider.</br>
* Do not store passwords in a file on ANY computer system (including Palm Pilots or similar devices) without encryption.</br>
* Change passwords at least once every 90 (ninety) days.</br>
* Do not let your computer remember your password. Do not accept auto complete option provided by your computer/ browser.</br>

<h1>Types of Online Fraud and Phishing Variations</h1>
<h3>Phishing Email and Fraudulent websites</h3>
<ul>
<li>Phishing is a general term for e-mails, text messages and websites fabricated and sent by criminals and designed to look like they come from well-known and trusted businesses, financial institutions and government agencies in an attempt to collect personal, financial and sensitive information. It’s also known as brand spoofing. If you should ever receive an email that appears to be suspicious, do not reply to it or click on the link it provides. Simply delete it. To report a suspicious email that uses SBI’s name, you can report to us immediately at report.phishing@sbi.co.in.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Popup windows/advertisements</h3>
<li>Pop-ups are the advertisements that "pop up" in a separate browser window. When you click on some of these pop-ups, it's possible that you're also downloading "spyware" or "adware."</li>
</ul>
<h3>Vishing</h3>
<ul>
<li>Vishing is the criminal practice of using social engineering and Voice over IP (VoIP) to gain access to private, personal and financial information from the public for the purpose of financial reward. The term is a combination of "voice" and phishing.

Scammers randomly dial phone numbers using an automated system or a real human being pretending they are calling on behalf of Bank/financial company asking you to update information regarding your, bank accounts, Card details etc. because there is a problem on your account or they may also say that they have made some upgrades into their system.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Smishing</h3>
<ul>
<li>Smishing is a form of criminal activity using social engineering techniques similar to phishing. Smishing victims receive SMS messages. Known as "smishing," these text messages might ask a recipient to register for an online service -- then try to sneak a virus onto the users' device. Some messages warn that the consumer will be charged unless he/she updates his/her personal or financial credentials in a Web site that then extracts such information and other private data.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Key logging</h3>
<ul>
<li>Unwanted Key-Logging software can record everything that is typed on a computer and send the information to an outside party. Key-Logging "Spyware" or "Adware" often infects a computer via a virus attached to an e-mail or other type of download.</li>
